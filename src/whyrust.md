 # Why Rust in Shakti ?


 Using Rust in the SHAKTI processor brings several advantages, aligning with Rust's strengths in system programming and embedded development. Here are key reasons for considering Rust in the context of the SHAKTI processor:

**Memory Safety** : Rust's ownership system and borrowing rules ensure memory safety without sacrificing performance. This is crucial in embedded systems where memory management is often critical for stability and security. Rust helps prevent common programming errors like null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows, leading to more robust and reliable code.

**Zero-Cost Abstractions** : Rust allows developers to write high-level, expressive code without incurring a runtime overhead. This is essential for embedded systems where resource constraints are common. The zero-cost abstractions provided by Rust enable efficient code execution without sacrificing readability or expressiveness.

**Concurrency and Parallelism** : Rust provides powerful abstractions for concurrent and parallel programming, making it well-suited for modern processors with multiple cores. This can enhance the performance of applications running on the SHAKTI processor, especially in scenarios where parallel processing is beneficial.

**Static Typing** : Rust's static typing system helps catch many common errors at compile time, reducing the likelihood of runtime failures. This is advantageous in embedded systems where debugging and maintenance can be challenging.

**Community and Ecosystem** : Rust has a vibrant and growing community with a focus on systems programming and embedded development. The availability of libraries, tools, and documentation makes it easier for developers working on the SHAKTI processor to find support and resources.

**Cross-Platform Development** : Rust supports cross-compilation, enabling developers to write code on one platform and deploy it on the SHAKTI processor or other architectures. This flexibility is beneficial for cross-platform development and porting code to different embedded systems.

**Open Source and Transparency** : Rust is an open-source language with a transparent development process. This aligns well with the principles of the SHAKTI project, which emphasizes openness and collaboration. The open nature of Rust fosters community involvement and innovation.

In summary, Rust's focus on safety, performance, and expressiveness, along with its strong community support, makes it a compelling choice for programming the SHAKTI processor, particularly in embedded and system-level development.

## why not c ?

C is a powerful and established language in embedded systems, but Rust provides a modern and safer alternative tailored for system-level programming challenges. The decision between Rust and C hinges on project requirements, developer preferences, and the goals of the embedded system. Rust's features, such as enhanced memory safety and zero-cost abstractions, make it particularly appealing for modern processors like SHAKTI, striking a balance between performance and safety.
